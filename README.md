# skidded plugins
SCP:SL server files i managed to steal after they doxxed me.

## Why?
I was a technician on 2 servers but they nuked one becuase "it was dead anyway" they said.
I spent at least 2 months working on that server because the owner did not give a shit.

So to ruin their work I deleted everything I could and made a copy to download then quiclky deleted it.
Thier discord server got nuked by me too. I banned all lower ranks.

## Betrayal
I was "friends" with a guy that went to the same online course as me. Never really knew him much anyway.
Well he knew my name from there. And I knew his. Though he didn't keep his as a secret so there was no point in revealing it anyway.

After all that. He just straight told them my name and probably more.
Honestly I knew this was gonna happen.
"Why would someone learn programming to make stupid plugins to a game" I said not realising I was talking about myself.
Correct. The course was as introduction to C#. The language of scp sl plugins.


At the time I'm writing this, I was messaged my name from a friend.
I feel like they want to change my mind or something. They know I have all this.
"You will ruin #####'s hopes and dreams if you do that!"
And after that. They come up to me with my real name out of nowhere.
Fucking random strangers know who I am.


### And that's why...
I'm uploading all of the server files here.
Not only they destroyed everything I made, but even expected me to keep working with them?

## present
I don't know what will be next. Do I apologize? Why would I?
They a lot from me.
Now I'll show them.


## Plugins
There are definetelly at least few plugins made by that "friend" here.
### if there arent any, call me an idiot.
